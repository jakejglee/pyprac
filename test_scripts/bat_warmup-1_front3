# Warmup-1: front3 
# Exercise taken from codingbat.com
# by Jake Lee, 11/24
# DESCRIPTION: Given a string, we'll say that the front is the first 3 chars of the string. If the string length is less than 3, the front is whatever is there. Return a new string which is 3 copies of the front.

def front3(str):
  thefront = str[0:3]
  return thefront + thefront + thefront
